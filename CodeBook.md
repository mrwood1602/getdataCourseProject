### Explanation of Feature names

A more thorough explanation can be found in the features_info.txt
 file included with the dataset. This is only a quick summary.
 
 
The feature names begin with either 't' or 'f' to denote time domain or
frequency domain respectively. The values are labeled with either 'Body'
or 'Gravity' to denote whether the signal was due to the body or due to
gravity. The values are also labeled with 'Acc' or 'Jerk' to denote 
whether it was an acceleration or a change in acceleration (jerk). And
the variables state whether they were obtained from the accelerometer or
the gyroscope, and 'X','Y','Z', or 'Mag' denote which axis was involved,
or if the magnitude is involved. Finally 'mean' or 'std' tell you 
whether the value in the dataset was the mean of raw data or the 
standard deviation of raw data.
